#### Cooling Load Implications for Office Buildings

**Seasonal Cooling Requirements**:

1. **Primary Cooling Season**: June, July, August
   - Maximum cooling loads expected
   - Consistent daily cooling requirement
   - Peak loads on hot days (>30°C)

2. **Shoulder Seasons**: May, September
   - Partial cooling requirements
   - Opportunity for free cooling
   - Variable daily loads

3. **Free Cooling Potential**: October-April
   - Ambient temperatures favorable for economizer operation
   - Minimal mechanical cooling required
   - Cooling may be needed for internal zones or high-load areas

**Design Considerations**:

**External Cooling Load Factors**:
- Solar heat gain through glazing (critical in summer)
- Envelope heat transmission
- Ventilation air cooling load

**Internal Cooling Load Factors**:
- Occupancy heat gains: 70-120 W/person
- Equipment/computer loads: 10-25 W/m²
- Lighting loads: 8-15 W/m² (LED), higher for older systems
- Internal loads dominant in office buildings

**Climate-Specific Strategies**:

1. **Night Ventilation/Cooling**:
   - Effective due to cool summer nights (~20°C)
   - Can reduce mechanical cooling requirement by 15-25%
   - Particularly effective with thermal mass

2. **Free Cooling Utilization**:
   - Economizer operation possible ~200-220 days/year
   - Significant energy savings potential
   - Important for chilled water systems (waterside economizer)

3. **Solar Protection**:
   - Critical for south and west facades
   - Peak solar gains coincide with peak temperatures
   - External shading reduces cooling load by 30-50%

**Typical Office Building Peak Cooling Load** (Vienna):
- Standard Office: **50-70 W/m²**
- High-Performance Office: **40-50 W/m²**
- High Internal Load Office: **70-90 W/m²**

**For 2,800 m² Office Building**:
- Peak cooling load estimate: **140-196 kW** (50-70 W/m²)
- Design chiller capacity: **150-200 kW** (with safety factor)
- Annual cooling hours: **800-1,200 hours** (full mechanical cooling)
- Free cooling hours: **1,500-2,000 hours** (partial/full free cooling)

#### Continental Climate Considerations

**Vienna Basin Influence**:
- Eastern location provides continental weather characteristics
- Less precipitation than western Austria
- Warmer summers than Alpine regions
- Colder winters than expected for latitude

**Climate Trends**:
- Increasing summer temperatures (climate change impact)
- More frequent heat waves (>30°C periods)
- Extended cooling season (earlier start, later end)
- Increased peak cooling loads in recent years

**Design Implications**:
- Size for future climate conditions (10-20 year projection)
- Plan for increased cooling degree days
- Consider resilience for extreme heat events
- Flexible system capacity important

**COP (Coefficient of Performance)**:
```
COP = Cooling Output (kW) / Electrical Input (kW)
```

**EER (Energy Efficiency Ratio)**:
```
EER = Cooling Output (Btu/h) / Electrical Input (W)
EER = COP × 3.412 (conversion factor)
```

**kW/ton (Alternative Efficiency Metric)**:
```
kW/ton = 3.517 / COP
```

**IPLV (Integrated Part Load Value)**:

Q_internal = Occupancy + Equipment + Lighting
Q_ventilation = Outdoor air sensible + latent loads
```

**Specific Cooling Load**:
```
q_specific = Q_peak / A_floor (W/m²)
```

**Annual Cooling Energy**:

E_annual = Q_peak × h_equivalent × (1/COP_seasonal)

Where:
h_equivalent = equivalent full load hours
COP_seasonal = seasonal average COP (≈ IPLV)
```

### 7.3 BAC Factor Method (ISO 52120-1)

**Energy Consumption with BAC Factor**:
```
E_actual = E_reference × fBAC

Where:
E_reference = Energy consumption with reference system (Class B)

NPV = Σ(CFt / (1+r)^t) - C0

Where:
CFt = Cash flow in year t
r = Discount rate
t = Time period (year)
C0 = Initial investment
```

**Annuity Calculation**:
```
A = (C0 × r × (1+r)^n) / ((1+r)^n - 1) + M + O

Where:
C0 = Initial investment
r = Interest rate
n = Technical lifespan (years)
M = Annual maintenance costs
O = Annual operating costs
```

**Lifecycle Cost**:

LCC = C0 + Σ(Mt + Ot + Rt - St) / (1+r)^t

Where:
C0 = Initial investment
Mt = Maintenance cost in year t
Ot = Operating cost in year t
Rt = Replacement cost in year t
St = Residual value in year t
```

### 7.5 Pump Energy Calculations

**Pump Power (Affinity Laws)**:
```
P2/P1 = (N2/N1)³

Where:
P = Pump power
N = Pump speed (RPM)
```

**Pump Energy Consumption**:
```
E_pump = (ΔP × Q × h) / (η_pump × η_motor × 3,600,000)

Where:
ΔP = Pressure difference (Pa)
Q = Flow rate (m³/h)
h = Operating hours (hours)
η_pump = Pump efficiency
η_motor = Motor efficiency
Result in kWh
```

**Specific Pump Energy**:

Where:
T_avg = Average daily temperature (°C)
T_base = Base temperature, typically 18°C or 65°F
Σ = Sum over all days in period
```

**Cooling Energy Estimate from CDD**:
```
E_cooling = CDD × A_floor × k_cooling / η_system

Where:
CDD = Cooling degree days
A_floor = Floor area (m²)
k_cooling = Building cooling coefficient (W/m²·K)
η_system = System efficiency (COP/SEER)
```
